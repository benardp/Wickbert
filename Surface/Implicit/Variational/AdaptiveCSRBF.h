/** @file AdaptiveCSRBF.h
 * Extension of SurfletCompactRBF to adaptively choose CSRBF centers
 * rather than have them be at every input data point. Following Ohtake, et al...
 * "3D Scattered Data Approximation with Adaptive Compactly Supported Radial Basis Functions"
 * Only the Adaptive Partition of Unity is implemented, since the RBF fitting part
 * would have almost no impact on the particle visualization (and the adaptive PU is slow enough already).

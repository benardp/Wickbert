Wickbert is a system that uses programmable particle systems to manipulate and display implicit surfaces. The name "Wickbert" is a contraction of Andrew Witkin and Paul Heckbert, the two authors of the paper Using Particles to Sample and Control Implicit Surfaces that described how to use a particle system to display and manipulate an implicit surface and inspired many other ideas. Wickbert extends this ideas into an implicit surface library and particle system programming environment to better foster new ideas in interactive shape modeling.
